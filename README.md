# Squirrel.js

A JavaScript rewrite (with some changes) of [Squirrel](https://github.com/escamilla/squirrel), an expression-oriented programming language I wrote in C#.

## Usage

```
# evaluate a source file and display the result
npm run eval <path>

# use the `-v | --verbose` flag to show more details including the parse tree
npm run eval -- -v <path>

# run unit tests
npm test
```
